# Scales4All
A simple program for finding scales/chords and making chord progression

This GUI program will give the user a scale in a designated mode with with a root note set by the user. The user can then find chors within the scale and add chords to a chord progression.
Itinially written in C++/Visual Studio 2015 and refactored with GUI support using Vim/G++/FLTK.

This is an individual project aimed at electronic musicians who are still learning music theory. This should enable such musicians to quickly find scales when writing music without needing Internet access, which can often be distracting and interupt such a musician's workflow.

To compile, you will need to install FLTK (http://www.fltk.org/software.php). Once installed, you should be able to use the included makefile. (Navigate to the directory containing these files in your terminal and enter "make".)

The executable file will be called "Scales".

You can clean up after make using "make clean". (This just removes the "Scales" file.)
